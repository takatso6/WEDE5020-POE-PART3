            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <img src="images/IMG-20250406-WA0060.jpg" alt="Founder at work" width="200">
            <p>Founded in 2020, SBU Shisanyama & Carwash began as a simple idea to combine two essential services that South Africans love - great food and clean cars. What started as a small roadside operation has grown into a beloved community hub.</p>
            <p>Our founder, Sibusiso "SBU" Mthembu, noticed that customers often wanted to enjoy a braai while waiting for their cars to be washed. This observation led to the unique combination that makes us special today.</p>
